Introduction to chat-gpt as a debugging tool.

## Debugging

### factorial.py
- Fixed infinite loop by decrementing `n` inside the loop.
- Added `debugging/factorial.py` to implement the corrected factorial script.
- Ensure `debugging/factorial.py` is executable (`chmod +x`) for the checker.

### print_arguments.py
- Print only user-provided arguments (skip the script name).
- Added `debugging/print_arguments.py`.
- Ensure `debugging/print_arguments.py` is executable (`chmod +x`) for the checker.

- Fixed DOM hookup so clicking the button changes the background color.

### mines.py
